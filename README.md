## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to validate form with JS. This project was also my first project using Tailwind where I had just began learning it. Also what I used for my first time was npm scripts and npm packages where I needed to find and learn packages by myself. While building a website the Tailwind was a nightmare when I just started writing it. Constant questions how to add font-size, border, custom border-radius etc., but after few hours of writing it, it really became handy to me, especially styling with use of group and peer. I also love the mobile-first tailwind approach and the performance of tailwind. My minified CSS would be only 8kB without purging it so it's pretty light ðŸ˜„

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me a lot during learning Tailwind. I really liked how good this documentation is written with dozens of examples.
- [Freecodecamp date validation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-validate-a-date-in-javascript/) - This  article helped me understand how to validate the date. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Kayle's form validation tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In0nB0ABaUk&pp=ygUdZm9ybSB2YWxpZGF0aW9uIGluIGphdmFzY3JpcHQ%3D) - This helped me getting overview on how to validate the forms in JS
